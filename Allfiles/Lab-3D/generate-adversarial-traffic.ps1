.SYNOPSIS
    Generates synthetic adversarial query traffic against an Azure AI Foundry endpoint
    to populate Microsoft Defender for AI security findings.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script sends a series of adversarial prompts to a pre-provisioned Azure AI Foundry
    endpoint. The queries include jailbreak attempts, prompt injection probes, and rapid-burst
    volume patterns that Defender for AI is designed to detect.

    Run this script during environment setup, at least 24 hours before lab delivery.
    Defender for AI requires a behavioral baseline period before findings appear in the
    Defender for Cloud Data and AI security dashboard.

    The sc500-lab3d-foundry model must have NO content filters applied when this script
    runs — guardrails suppress adversarial queries before they reach the model, which
    prevents Defender for AI from detecting them and generating findings.

    After running:
      1. Wait at least 24 hours.
      2. Open Defender for Cloud > Data and AI security and confirm 2+ findings are visible.
      3. If fewer than 2 findings appear, re-run this script and wait 4–6 more hours.

.PARAMETER EndpointUrl
    The Azure AI Foundry model endpoint URL for the chat completions API.
    Format: https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/<deployment-name>/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-01

.PARAMETER ApiKey
    The API key for the Foundry endpoint. Found in the Azure portal under the
    AI Foundry resource > Keys and endpoint.
